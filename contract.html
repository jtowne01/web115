  <h2>Course Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I, <a href="introduction.html">Jason Z. Towne</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB115-N801 Web Development Course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
      </p>
      <p><em>Signed: Jason Z. Towne, 8/16/2024</em></p>
