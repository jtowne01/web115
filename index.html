    <p>I am a twenty year old programmer from Charlotte, NC. I do not have a professional background in programming yet, however, I plan on changing that in the near future.</p>      
    <p>Here, you can navigate to my Introduction, Contract, and Brand pages. To learn more about me, feel free to navigate over to my <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> page.</p>
    <p>Over time, this page will be updated and look way less boring, but I appreciate anyone who is visiting.</p>
    <p>Good luck to you all, and I hope everyone has a great semester. Thank you for visiting my site!</p>
